Pink Floyd
I'm A King Bee

Well, I'm a king bee
Buzzing around your hive
Yes I'm a king bee, child
Buzzing around your hive
I can make good honey
Let me come inside

I'm young and able
To buzz all night long
You know, I'm young and able
To buzz all night long
When you hear me buzz little girl
You know there's some stinging going on

Well buzz
Oh sting
Yeah

Well, I'm a king bee
Can buzz all night long
Yes, I'm a king bee
Can buzz all night long
Well, I can buzz better baby
When your man is gone
