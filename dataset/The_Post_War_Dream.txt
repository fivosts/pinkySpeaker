Tell me true. Tell me why
Was Jesus crucified?
Was it for this that daddy died?

Was it you? Was it me?
Did I watch too much T.V.?
Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes?

If it wasn't for the Nips
Being so good at building ships
The yards would still be open on the Clyde.

And it can't be much fun for them
Beneath the rising sun
With all their kids committing suicide

What have we done?
Maggie, what have we done?
What have we done to England?

Should we shout? Should we scream?
What happened to the post-war dream?
Oh, Maggie, Maggie, what did we do?
