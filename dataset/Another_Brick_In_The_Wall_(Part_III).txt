Pink Floyd
Another Brick In The Wall (Part III)

I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all

No, don't think I'll need anything at all

All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall
