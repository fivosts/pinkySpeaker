Pink Floyd
The Show Must Go On

Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Must the show go on?

Ooh Pa take me home
Ooh Ma let me go

There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them take away my soul
Am I too old? Is it too late?

Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Where has the feeling gone?
Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Will I remember the songs?
Ooh ah the show must go on.
