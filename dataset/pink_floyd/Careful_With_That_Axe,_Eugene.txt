Pink Floyd
Careful With That Axe, Eugene

Down, down. Down, down. The star is screaming.
Beneath the lies. Lie, lie. Tschay, tschay, tschay.
[Sound of Waters blowing into the microphone]
[Light screaming from Waters]
Careful, careful, careful with that axe, Eugene.
[Very loud and prolonged scream]
[Another very loud and prolonged scream]
[Waters blowing into the microphone]
[Light screaming from Waters]
The stars are screaming loud.
Tsch.
Tsch.
Tsch.
[Low groaning sound from Waters]
