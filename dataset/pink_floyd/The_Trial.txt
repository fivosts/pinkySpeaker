Pink Floyd
The Trial

[Prosecutor:]
Good morning, the Worm your honour
The crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do

Call the schoolmaster!

[Teacher:]
I always said he'd come to no good
In the end, your honour
If they'd let me have my way
I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today

[Pink:]
Crazy
Toys in the attic,
I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away

[Choir:]
Crazy
Toys in the attic
He is crazy

[Wife:]
You little shit, you're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should've talked to me more often than you did,
But no, you had to go your own way.
Have you broken any homes up lately?

"Just five minutes, Worm your honour, him and me alone"

[Mother:]
Babe
Come to mother, baby, let me hold you in my arms
M'Lord I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm your honour, let me take him home

[Pink:]
Crazy
Over the rainbow
I am crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in

[Choir:]
Crazy
Over the rainbow
He is crazy

[Worm:]
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible.
There's no need for the jury to retire.
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving the full penalty of law.
The way you made them suffer—
Your exquisite wife and mother—
Fills me with the urge to defecate
(Go on, judge. Shit on him.)
Since, my friend, you have revealed
Your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers.

Tear down the wall

[Choir:]
Tear down the wall [repeat]
