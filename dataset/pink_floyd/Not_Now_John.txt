Not Now John

Hey, listen. It's a

Fuck all that we've gotta get on with these
Fuck all that, fuck all that
Gotta compete with the wily Japanese
There's too many home fires burning and not enough trees
Fuck all that
So fuck all that we've gotta get on with these
Gotta get on with these

Can't stop lose job mind gone silicon
Star long what bomb get away pay day make hay
Break down need fix big six
Click click hold on oh no 
Bingo! (Bingo!)

Make em laugh
Make em cry
Make em dance in the aisles
Make em pay
Make em stay
Make em feel OK

Not now John
We've gotta get on with the film show
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
(End of the rainbow)
Who cares what it's about
As long as the kids go
(As long as the kids go)
So, not now John
We've gotta get on with the show
(gotta get on with the show)
(gotta get on, gotta get on)

(gotta get on, gotta get on)
(gotta get on)

Hang on John
I've gotta get on with this
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
Don't know what it is
But it fits on here like this 
Come at the end of the shift
We'll go and get pissed
But not now John
I've gotta get on with this
(gotta get on with this, gotta get on)

Hold on John
I think there's something good on
I used to read books but 
It could be the news
Or some other amusement
Could be re-usable shows

Fuck all that we've gotta get on with these
Gotta compete with the wily Japanese
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
No need to worry about the Vietnamese
Gotta bring the Russian bear to his knees
(gotta get on)

Well, maybe not the Russian bear
Maybe the Swedes
We showed Argentina, now let's go and show these
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
Make us feel tough and wouldn't Maggie be pleased
Nah nah nah nah nah nah!

One, two, three, four
(Not now John we've gotta get on)

S'cusi dove il bar?
What?
(gotta get on)
Se parakalo pou einai to bar?
(Not now John we've gotta get on)

S'il vous pla√Æt ou est le bar
(gotta get on, gotta get on)

Oi' where's the fucking bar John!
(Not now John we've gotta get on)
Oh, now you're talking!
Oh! Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the day
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
Down!
(Not now John we've gotta get on)
Go, Maggie!
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, now!
(Not now John we've gotta get on)
(gotta get on, gotta get on)
