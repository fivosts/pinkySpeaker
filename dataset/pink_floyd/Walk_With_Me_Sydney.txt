Walk With Me Sydney

Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh, walk with me, Sydney
I love to, love to, love to, baby you know
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh, walk with me, Sydney
I love to, love to, love to, love to, love to

Walk with me, Sydney, it's a dark night
Come on, come on, hold me tight
Well I love to, love to, love to
But I got

Flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
DTs and a washed-out brain

Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh, roll with me, Sydney
I love to, love to, love to, baby you know
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh, roll with me, Sydney
I love to, love to, love to, love to, love to

Roll with me, Sydney, it's a dark night
Roll me, roll me, roll me high
Well I love to, love to, love to
But I got

Flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
DTs and a washed-out brain

Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh, walk with me, Sydney
I love to, love to, love to, baby you know
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oooh, walk with me, Sydney
I love to, love to, love to, love to, love to

Walk with me, Sydney, it's a dark night
Come on, come on, hold me tight
Well I love to, love to, love to
But I got

Flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
DTs and a washed-out brain
