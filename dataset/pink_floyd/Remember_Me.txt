Remember Me

Remember me (aaaaah-ha)
I've been here before
Remember me (aaaaah-ha)
I've been here before
Can't you see
I'm gonna stick around some more

Can't you see (aaaaah-ha)
I want some love from you
Can't you see (aaaaah-ha)
I want some love from you
Don't go away now
I've got something to give to you

I'll try to be (aaaaa-ha)
As good as gold to you
Try to be (aaaaa-ha)
As good as gold to you
But don't blame me, girl
If I'm far from cold to you

Remember me (aaaaa-ha)
I've been here before
Remember me (aaaaa-ha)
I've been here before
Don't go away now
Come and stick around some more
Yeah
