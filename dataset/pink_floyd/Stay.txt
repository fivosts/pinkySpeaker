Pink Floyd
Stay

Stay
And help me to end the day.
And if you don't mind
We'll break a bottle of wine.

Stick around
And maybe we'll put one down,
'Cause I wanna find
What lies behind those eyes.

Midnight blue burning gold.
A yellow moon is growing cold.

I rise
Looking through my morning eyes,
Surprised
To find you by my side.

Rack my brain
To try to remember your name
To find
The words to tell you goodbye.

Morning dues.
Newborn day.
Midnight blue
Turn to gray.

Midnight blue burning gold.
A yellow moon is growing cold.
