Pink Floyd
One Of My Turns

"Oh my God! What a fabulous room! Are all these your guitars?"
[Film in background:] ("I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to startle you!")
"What? This place is bigger than our apartment!"
("Let me know when you're entering a room.")
("Yes, sir!")
"Can I get a drink of water?"
("I was wondering about dinner, sir.)
"You want some, huh?"
("Yes?")
("When do you and your guests want to dine? I have to inform the kitchen staff.")
"Oh wow, look at this tub? Wanna take a bath?"
("Yes, I'm aware of your duties Dobbs.")
("Yes, sir.")
(I'll have to find out from Mrs. Bancroft what time she wants to eat. As for her maid, needless to say, she can have her meal with the kitchen help.)
"What are you watching?"
("Very good, sir. If you'll just let me know as soon as you can when you and Mrs Bancroft want to eat.")
("Mrs. Bancroft will be dining alone.")
"Hello?"
("Why? I don't understand, sir.")
("I won't be staying for dinner.")
"Are you feeling okay?..."
("I'm surprised to hear that, sir, since you just arrived.")
("Yes, I'm a little surprised about it myself.")

Day after day, love turns grey
Like the skin of a dying man
Night after night, we pretend it's all right
But I have grown older and
You have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade
Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

Run to the bedroom
In the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch T.V.?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?
Would you?
Would you like to see me try?

Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?
