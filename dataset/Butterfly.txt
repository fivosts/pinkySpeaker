Pink Floyd
Butterfly

Listen all you girlies
Even though I haven't met you
Gonna catch you soon
In my butterfly net
You'd better watch out

Sometimes when I watch you
I stretch out my hand to touch you
'Cause it drives my me wild
To see you flutter by
You butterfly

I won't squeeze you dead
Aiming through your head
I just want your love

I won't cry your name
In Latin, in the rain
'Cause raining, it's a shame

Listen all you girlies
Even though I haven't met you
Gonna catch you soon
In my butterfly net
You'd better watch out
