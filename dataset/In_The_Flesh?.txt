Pink Floyd
In The Flesh?

(We came in)

So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?

If you want to find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise
