Pink Floyd
Louder Than Words

We bitch and we fight
Diss each other on sight
But this thing we do

These times together
Rain or shine or stormy weather
This thing we do

With world-weary grace
We've taken our places
We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name

Or stay home by the fire
Felled by desire
Stoking the flame
But we're here for the ride

It's Louder than words this thing that we do
Louder than words – the way it unfurls
It's louder than words – the sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts is louder than words
Louder than words

The strings bend and slide as the hours glide by
An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues, gonna tap out the rhythm

Let's go with the flow
Wherever it goes
We're more than alive

It's Louder than words this thing that we do
Louder than words – the way it unfurls
It's louder than words – the sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts is louder than words
Louder than words – this thing they call soul
It's there with a pulse louder than words
Louder than words
