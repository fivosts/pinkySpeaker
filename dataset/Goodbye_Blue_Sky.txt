Pink Floyd
Goodbye Blue Sky

[A child's voice:]
Look, Mummy. There's an airplane up in the sky.

Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
Did, did, did, did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfurled beneath a clear blue sky?

Did, did, did, did you see the frightened ones?
Did, did, did, did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone
But the pain lingers on

Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye
